		<h1>Browser Compatibility</h1>

		<p>The web is for everyone, but <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/">support is not the same as optimization</a>.</p>

		<p>Rather than trying to provide the same level of functionality for older browsers, Kraken uses progressive enhancement to serve a basic experience to all browsers (even Netscape and IE 5). Newer browsers that support modern APIs and techniques get a better layout, more visually attractive elements, and an enhanced experience.

		<p>Kraken works in all browsers, but it's optimized for modern browsers and IE 9+.</p>

		<h2>Vendor Prefixing</h2>

		<p>Kraken uses <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a>, and is configured to only add prefixes if required by the last two versions of a browser.</p>

		<p>If a feature isn't working (for example, the grid does not work in Firefox 28 and lower), it may simply need a vendor prefix. You can add these manually, or adjust the Autoprefixer settings in <code>gulpfile.js</code> if you're working with the source code.</p>

		<p>For more details on when support for specific features were added to different browsers, consult <a href="http://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a>.</p>
