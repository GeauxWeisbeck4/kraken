		<h1>Browser Compatibility</h1>

		<p>The web is for everyone, but support is not the same as optimization.</p>

		<p>Rather than trying to provide the same level of functionality for older browsers, Kraken uses progressive enhancement to serve a basic experience to all browsers (even Netscape and IE 5). Newer browsers that support modern APIs and techniques get a better layout, more visually attractive elements, and an enhanced experience.

		<p>Kraken works in all browsers, but it's optimized for modern browsers and IE 9+.</p>
