		<h1>Generating Documentation</h1>

		<p>Kraken ships with a simple documentation generator powered by <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp.js</a>. Unfortunately, if you're uncomfortable using terminal, you won't be able to take advantage of this feature.</p>

		<p>Documentation files can be found under <code>src</code> > <code>docs</code>, and compile to <code>docs</code>.</p>

		<h2>How to Create Docs</h2>

		<p>Create HTML or markdown (<code>.md</code> or <code>.markdown</code>) files to your <code>docs</code> folder in <code>src</code>.</p>

		<p>The <code>_templates</code> directory in <code>src</code> contains the <code>_header.html</code> and <code>_footer.html</code> templates. These are automatically added to the beginning and end of each documentation page. You can also add your own templates to the <code>_templates</code> directory. Include template files in your docs by writing <code>&commat;&commat;include('path-to-file')</code> on its own line in your markup (or markdown).</p>

		<p>Files placed in the <code>assets</code> directory will be moved over as-is to the <code>docs</code> directory. Kraken will also add a copy of your <code>dist</code> files so you can use them in your documentation.</p>

		<p>When you're ready, run <code>gulp docs</code> in terminal.</p>


		<h2>Why not use an existing documentation tool?</h2>

		<p>There are a ton of create CSS and JS documentation tools available. I explored using <a href="http://warpspire.com/kss/">KSS</a>, <a href="http://trulia.github.io/hologram/">Hologram</a>, and a few others.</p>

		<p>I found myself frustrated by the lack of control over the layout, the clutter added to the stylesheet, and the complexity in getting setup.</p>

		<p>I decided creating my own documentation tool was a better fit for my needs. Obviously, feel free to use the documentation tool that best fits your needs.</p>
