## Updated "What's Included?" section

1. 	Essential components
	Lightweight, style-agnostic components to kick-start your next project.
		* CSS Reset to smooth out cross-browser quirks
		* Responsive, mobile-first grid
		* A well-designed, fluid typographic scale.
		* CSS buttons
		* Common form elements

2. 	Developer Tools
	Kraken is powered by Gulp.js, a build system that minifies and concatenates your Sass and JavaScript, auto-prefixes your CSS, runs unit tests on your scripts, and generates SVG sprites. It also includes a documentation builder to help you quickly bring your team or clients up-to-speed.

3. 	Add-Ons
	While the base boilerplate is deliberately lightweight, a growing collection of add-ons lets you make Kraken as robust&mdash;or simple&mdash;as you want it to be. Create custom-built sites and applications faster.
